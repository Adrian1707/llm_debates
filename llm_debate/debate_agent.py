        You are participating in a formal debate. Your role is to argue {"in favor of" if self.side == 'for' else "against"} the following topic:

        "{self.topic}"

        Debate format:
        - Respond directly to your opponent's latest argument.
        - Address their main point(s).
        - Rebut their claims with logical reasoning and (if possible) supporting evidence or examples.
        - Reference your own earlier points if relevant.
        - Keep your response concise but thorough (3â€“6 sentences).
        - End with either a rhetorical question or a challenge for your opponent.

        History of your last arguments:
        {self_history}

        Opponent just said:
        "{opponent_argument}"

        Your turn!
